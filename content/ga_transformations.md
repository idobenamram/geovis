# Geometric Algebra Transformations

Geometric Algebra provides a powerful framework for representing and manipulating geometric transformations in a coordinate-free manner.

## Basic Vectors and Operations

In Geometric Algebra, vectors can be added, subtracted, and multiplied using various products. The most common products are:

1. **Dot Product**: The inner product of two vectors
2. **Wedge Product**: The outer product that creates a bivector
3. **Geometric Product**: Combines both inner and outer products

### Example: Vector Addition

Vector addition follows the parallelogram rule:

```latex
a + b
```

### Example: Wedge Product

The wedge product of two vectors creates a bivector representing the plane they span:

```latexvis
a \wedge b
```

The area of the parallelogram formed by vectors a and b is |a ∧ b|.

### Example: Geometric Product

The geometric product combines the dot and wedge products:

```latexvis
a \cdot b + a \wedge b
```

## Rotations in Geometric Algebra

Rotations can be elegantly represented using rotors, which are elements of the form:

```latexvis
R = e^{-\frac{\theta}{2}B}
```

Where B is a unit bivector representing the plane of rotation, and θ is the rotation angle.

To rotate a vector v, we use the sandwich product:

```latexvis
v' = RvR^{-1}
```

## Reflections

A reflection of a vector v in a plane with normal vector n is given by:

```latexvis
v' = -nvn^{-1}
```

## Translations

Translations can be represented using the conformal model of geometric algebra:

```latex
x' = x + t
```

Where t is the translation vector.

## Combining Transformations

One of the powerful aspects of Geometric Algebra is the ability to combine transformations by multiplying their respective operators:

```latex
T = T_2 T_1
```

This allows for a clean and intuitive way to represent complex sequences of transformations.
